# hello-world

Hi Peeps,

Scott here, I thought I'd give Github a go since I advise engineering students to create and host their projects and hackathons on Git. As a technical writer I enjoy all the instructional design, taxonomy, and of course coding. I need to brush up on my JavaScript and C++. Here to learn and do more.
